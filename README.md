Hikingman is a web application that provides hikers with essential weather information for mountainous areas. The data source is the Central Weather Bureau, which is a reliable source of weather information in Taiwan.

Hikingman allows users to quickly browse the current weather conditions for all the mountains on the list. Users can also access more detailed information for each mountain by navigating to the mountain's individual page. The detailed information includes weekly and three-hourly weather forecasts. Furthermore, users can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit and change the language to English to cater to their preferences.

Our team is dedicated to continuously improving Hikingman's functionality and adding new features to enhance the user experience. Please stay tuned for exciting updates in the near future.

Thank you for choosing Hikingman as your go-to source for mountain weather information.
